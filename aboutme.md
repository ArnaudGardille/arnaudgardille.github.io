Hello! I am Master student in Mathematics and Machine Learning at [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) in [ENS Paris Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/), I am currently doing an intership in Reiforcement Learning at [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/page-daccueil) in [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) supervised by [Stéphanie Allassonnière](https://sites.google.com/site/stephanieallassonniere/) at Université of Paris and [Erwan Le Pennec](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~lepennec/fr/) at Ecole Polytechnique. 

I am interested in systems at the intersection of mathematics and computation, to have analytical insights on real-world applications and especially Medecine and Biology.
My current intership is focused on application of Reinforcement Learning for optimisation of medical trajectory to avoid diagnostic wandering in rare diseases. I also have a great interest in Computational Statistics, Probabilistic Graphical Models and Unsupervised Learning and its application into Biomedical field.

Previously I have worked in a project, [Alcov2](https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/actualites/Alcov2-Enquete-pour-l-etude-de-la-transmission-de-SARS-Cov2-au-sein-des-foyers-francais.htm) on prediction of probability of transmission of Covid 19 of into French household under supervision of [Grégory Nuel](http://nuel.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) and [Amaury Lambert](https://www.lpsm.paris/pageperso/amaury.lambert/).
 
In 2020, I did a Master of Applied Mathematics from [KTH, Royal Institut of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en), Stockholm. At the same time, I obtained an engineering degree at [Ecole Centrale de Lille](https://centralelille.fr/).
