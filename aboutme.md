Hello! I am currently a PhD candidate in Statistics and Machine Learning. I am working at [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/page-daccueil) in [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) supervised by [Stéphanie Allassonnière](https://sites.google.com/site/stephanieallassonniere/) and [Erwan Le Pennec](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~lepennec/fr/). I am also part of the [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr) team [HeKA](https://team.inria.fr/heka/) focused on Health data and model-driven Knowledge Acquisition. Before this, I was a Master student in Mathematics and Machine Learning at [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) in [ENS Paris Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).

I am interested in systems at the intersection of mathematics and computation, in having analytical insights on real-world applications, especially Medecine and Biology.
My current PhD  subject is focused on application of **Distributional Reinforcement Learning** for optimisation of medical trajectory to avoid diagnostic wandering in rare diseases. I also have a great interest in :
- **Computational Statistics**
- **Probabilistic Graphical Models**
- **Unsupervised Learning**.

Previously I have worked in a project, [Alcov2](https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/actualites/Alcov2-Enquete-pour-l-etude-de-la-transmission-de-SARS-Cov2-au-sein-des-foyers-francais.htm) on prediction of probability of transmission of Covid 19 into French households under supervision of [Grégory Nuel](http://nuel.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) and [Amaury Lambert](https://www.lpsm.paris/pageperso/amaury.lambert/).
