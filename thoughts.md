# Reinforcement Learning and Causality

When deep learning provides very efficient methods for perception, the decisional part of AI remains very limited. In deed, although AI now overcome humains at many board games, they thrive to generalise, and to take adventage of the deterministic laws of realistic environment.

Reinforcement Learning appears as a very promising paradigm for decision-based machine learning. Its results are quite impressive regarding the few informations it requires and the generality of its appication. In fact, it only requires a numerical reward signal, and tries to maximise its upcomming sum in expectation. the envionment is simply supposed to be markovian, that is to say that its dynamic only depends on the current state. That is true in many board or atari games, but quickly becomes false when the information is incomplete.

Although the theory is appealing, Reinforcement Learning suffers from several drawbacks, among which:
* sample inefficiency: It requieres a considerable amount of samples to hope for the convergence of the learning. 
* lack of generalisation ability to similar environments.

Those limits 
But I believe the shift from statistical to causal foundations could revolutionise decision-based AI, and would love to pursue with a Phd on this subject.
